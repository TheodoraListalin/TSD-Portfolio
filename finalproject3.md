<h2>Part 1 Summary</h2>
I wanted to tell a story that about some DEI issue and chose to talk about gender equity, since that is the topic I am most familiar with. I wrote my master thesis on the topic. Gender budgeting or assessing how public finance should be allocated according to the needs of each gender is something that has become popular in many European countries, especially in the Nordic countries. The first time I heard about it was three years ago in a public policy class on gender equity. The narrative of the story was supposed to start out establishing the status quo which is pretty bleak and kind off hopeless, but hopefully with the intervention of implementing this tool that would make people feel more hopeful and that we can make systematic changes. For the first part of the project, I spent most of my time looking for data to go along with the story I wanted to tell. There is a lot of quantitative data out there about gender disparities. The one that I am most familiar with from other experiences was the Gender Gap Index from the World Economic Forum. But I ran into some trouble since there wasn’t exact data available to support my call to action. I then tried to find data that shows the status quo – there is a plethora of that. And then I compared the US to SWE, one country has implemented GB successfully and one has not, and that gives a stark contrast. 

<h2>Part 2 Summary</h2>
I had made slides to draft the narrative, similar to how I learned to do them in Strategic Presentation Skills. There was a lot of data available about the status quo, but not about the benefits that has been shown for implementing GB, so I made simple viz using a map to showcase the OECD countries that have done so. I interviewed three friends at Heinz College. I was surprised that there wasn’t more of an trend in the responses. But people were surprised/bummed out that the USA wasn’t doing better in tackling gender disparities but they liked the map.

<h2>Part 3 Summary</h2>
I unfortunately didn’t see the feedback before my presentation on Tuesday. So I essentially uploaded information from the slides into a shorthand presentation. It was easier than I thought to work on shorthand. There was a lot of information, and it was a balancing act to make sure that the story was deliberate enough to present in one minute. So I left out the comparison between the USA and Sweden for the presentation. But on second thought after the presentation – maybe it would have been better to keep it in there since that data is the juiciest part of the story. When comparing the two countries there was not a big numeric difference, but the social impact is significant, so I made the decision to have the x-axis start on 0.6 to showcase more of a distance between the two.
