<h2>Original Visualization</h2>

Earlier this year I had inherited a role where I need to present a report to academics. The report has many data visualizations, including the one below. 
I chose this one because when I was originally presenting the report I stumbled on my words because the titles of the variables were incomplete. And one would have to search within the wordy report to find the full title of some of the variables. 
Also the structure does not tell a story, its just random data thrown together – I have to look for a long time to figure out the top 3.

<h2>Interviews</h2>
Too many variables to hold in working memory, still a lot going on in the visualizations 

I had faced my limitations in excel and when I uploaded the data into Tableau it didn’t really work, and I quit out of frustration. 

It was consistent that people suggested grouping together similar variables e.g. compromise and yield
