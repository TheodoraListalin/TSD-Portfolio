# Final Project 

<h2> An Outline </h2>

<h3> Status Quo / Baseline </h3>
Gender equity is a controversial topic. Some believe that western societies have reached gender equity with allowing women to vote and own property. On the other hand, a number of policy analysts and academics have conducted research and shed a light on the social and economic barriers that women face on the basis of gender, this includes the pay gap, the third shift, unpaid domestic and emotional labor. With this notion, many modern governments have established policies alternatives to combat these disparities systematically.

<h3> Conflict </h3>
To be able to combat gender disparities, that is to design robust policy alternatives we need <b>data!</b> 

<strong>But, there is a significant lack of gendered disaggregated data in most countries.</strong> 
Out of the 33 OECD countries, only two countries, Sweden and Norway report that they have significant gendered disaggregated data.

<h3> Resolution Proposed </h3>
Implementing a governmental analysis tool called <strong>Gender Budgeting.</strong> There is strong evidence that implementing this into governmental practices will benefit society. Methods within this toolbox include an EX Ante analysis, need base budgeting and/or gender audit. 

<h3> Looking forward </h3>
This is a relative new tool and there have been obstacles in people's belief in their usefulness. But there is evidence to support that as a secondary benefit, implementing Gender Budgeting increases awareness within the government body of gender equtiy and its importance. And there will be more research to come in the future.

<h2> The Data </h2>

[The Gender Gap Index](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2022.pdf) is the primary resource of data for establishing the baseline of gender disparities. It has been published annually since 2006 when it originally benchmarked the state of gender parity and has assessed the progress of gender equity annually. It analyses the state across four dimensions (Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment) in 146 countries. In the last report of 2022, The United States is ranked globally at 27 with a score of 0.769 (on a scale of 0-1). I plan on using this data to give an overview of gender disparities. 

[Gender Budgeting in the G20 Countries](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/11/12/Gender-Budgeting-in-G20-Countries-506816#:~:text=IMF%20Working%20Papers&text=Gender%20budgeting%20(GB)%20can%20help,gathered%20from%20an%20IMF%20survey.#:~:text=IMF%20Working%20Papers&text=Gender%20budgeting%20(GB)%20can%20help,gathered%20from%20an%20IMF%20survey) The second source of data is from the International Monetary Fund. In this paper there is a discussion of the benefits and biggest obstacles in gender budgeting as well as giving an overview of the process. It is about gender budgeting in the G20 countries, including the United States. I plan to use data from this report to support the notion of implementing gender budgeting.

[Gender Budgeting in the OECD Countries](https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/gender-budgeting.htm) The topic has been a work in progress for the OECD for the past decade. On this website there is a plethora of data from implementing in different countries, to the frameworks of the applying the tools. [This article](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/gender-budgeting-in-oecd-countries_budget-16-5jfq80dq1zbn#page22) in particular is very robust. This data will be used as evidence and case studies to support the implementation of gender budgeting. 

<h2> Method and Medium </h2>
For my final project I plan on using Shorthand. I believe that it is a good platform to present a story in a linear perspective, create ‘’Build up” and flow of the story. I have not yet decided what features on Shorthand I would like to attach to each section or how to weigh them  but I am sure that it will become clearer as the project progresses. After the demo in class, I feel more confident exploring the possibilities of Shorthand.
