# User and Research Protocol
<h2> Target Audience </h2>
The target audience would entail future policy makers and changers. Specifically people who are interested and curious about gender equity, policy strategies, and governmental procedures. 
<h2> Identifying representative individuals to interview </h2>
 Heinz College, School of Public Policy and Information Systems has a sprawling population of great minds, who are passionate about social issues, equity and emerging technology. The age range is from 22 and up. The interviewees were chosen by connivence. 

# Interview Structure

| Goal                               | Question      |
| ---------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Where is the weight of the story | What information/data stuck out in your mind? |
| Any unanswered questions   | Was something missing? / Was something that evoked your curiosity that was not mentioned? |
| What to emphasis, keep in or expand     | What worked? And why?    |
| What to make clearer or take out | What didn’t work? And why?  |
| Is there something I did not ask already | Anything else you would like to add? |

# Interview Feedback 

|                                | Interviewee 1 | Interviewee 2 | Interviewee 3 | 
| ------------------------------ |:-------------:|--------------:| -------------:|
| What information/data stuck out in your mind? | Values of the gender pay gap, it was on top and bolded. The map and labeling different steps in the process| The gender gap in the US is not high enough | Comparison between US and Sweden, the later having better welfare measures, but US having a better score for overall income
| Was something missing? / Was something that evoked your curiosity that was not mentioned?| The ambiguity of the scale – what does the Gender Pay Gap entail? The map – what does it mean? Limitations need more work. What the process policy options mean | What gender budgeting is – how is it implemented and etc, and what the process tools are. Maybe include comparison of US vs. other countries, for e.g. the Gender Pay Gap | How it has changes overtime, for the US and other countries, before 1980 until now, especially after the Regan administration. What are the causal variables. More visualizations with comparisons.  
| What worked? And why? | The emphasis on the data, the figures dominant on the slide | The map was interesting and easy to navigate, rather than the pie chart in the original data | Comparison worked well, pretty stark. The explanation of the tools is good, revert back to that at the end |
| What didn’t work? And why? | Some things were missing context | The coloring in the map can’t be red and green. I also thought that the red countries were the ones that had implemented the policy but it was actually the opposite | Explain top processes. How would this address private industry? |
| Anything else you would like to add? | Include a section of opportunity cost of not implementing gender budgeting | Interesting topic, kind of depression how the US does not have the right political view. Maybe have the global stats more “cartoonish” | You’re on the right track |

# Next Steps 
Next steps for me include,
-	Update the colors for the world map 
-	Have a clearer explanation of what the Gender Pay Gap is, what the data that is being used actually entails 
-	Have a stronger ending 
-	Refine the data visualizations, e.g. the comparisons, and how things have progressed.
